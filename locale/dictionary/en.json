        "question": "What is TLC insurance and why do I need it?",
        "answer": "TLC insurance is commercial auto insurance required by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission for all for-hire vehicles. It provides higher liability limits than personal auto insurance to protect you, your passengers, and other drivers. Without valid TLC insurance, you cannot legally operate as a for-hire driver in NYC."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "What types of vehicles do you insure?",
        "answer": "We insure all TLC-licensed vehicles including Uber and Lyft cars, yellow and green taxis, black cars, livery vehicles, and fleet vehicles. Whether you operate independently or manage multiple cars, we have tailored coverage options."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What's the difference between liability and full coverage?",
        "answer": "Liability coverage protects others if you are at fault in an accident, while full coverage includes liability plus protection for your own vehicle through comprehensive and collision coverage. Most TLC drivers choose full coverage for maximum protection."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "What are the minimum insurance requirements for TLC drivers?",
        "answer": "TLC drivers in NYC must meet strict liability requirements, typically including $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident, and $50,000 for property damage. Additional coverage may be required depending on your vehicle type and base affiliation."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "How much does TLC insurance cost?",
        "answer": "The cost varies depending on your driving history, vehicle type, coverage level, and experience. On average, TLC insurance is more expensive than personal auto insurance, but we help you find the most competitive rates available."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Do you offer payment plans?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer flexible payment plans to make your insurance more affordable. Options may include monthly payments or low down payment plans depending on the carrier."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "How long does it take to get insured?",
        "answer": "In many cases, we can get you insured the same day. Our fast process ensures you can get on the road quickly without unnecessary delays."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "What documents do I need to get a quote?",
        "answer": "Typically, you will need your driver’s license, vehicle registration, TLC license, and driving history. Additional documents may be required depending on your situation."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "How do I switch my insurance broker?",
        "answer": "Switching brokers is simple. We handle most of the process for you, including communicating with your current provider to ensure a smooth transition without gaps in coverage."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "Will switching brokers save me money?",
        "answer": "In many cases, yes. We compare multiple insurance carriers to find better rates and coverage options, helping you save money while maintaining or improving your protection."
      },
      "10": {
        "question": "What should I do if I'm in an accident?",
        "answer": "First, ensure everyone is safe and call emergency services if needed. Then document the scene, exchange information, and contact us immediately. We will guide you through the claims process step by step."
      },
      "11": {
        "question": "Do you help with TLC license renewals?",
        "answer": "Yes, we assist with TLC license renewals and ensure all insurance requirements are met so you can continue operating without interruptions."
